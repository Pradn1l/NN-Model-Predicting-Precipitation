# Predicting-Rain-in-Austrailia-NN

keywords: pytorch, Google Colab Notebook, logistic regression, relu, Adam optimizer, 3-layers

This repo involves is a guide for beginners through a simple Neural Network Model that could predict (logistic regression) if it would rain tomorrow in a city (provided data: Austrailia). 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

The code is based on the blog on Curiousily by Venelin Valkov. I strongly recommend to check it out for more clarification: https://curiousily.com/posts/build-your-first-neural-network-with-pytorch/

The notebook is easy to follow and involves comments and links for the beginners to follow.
